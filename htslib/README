HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
formats, such as SAM, CRAM, VCF, and BCF, used for high-throughput sequencing
data.  It is the core library used by samtools and bcftools.

See INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

* Due to unsupported memory operation in Emscripten, htslib is slightly modified by Jeongbin Park.
